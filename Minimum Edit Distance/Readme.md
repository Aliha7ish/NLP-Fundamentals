# ✍️ Minimum Edit Distance (MED) from Scratch — Shakespeare Text

This project implements the **Minimum Edit Distance algorithm** from scratch using **Dynamic Programming**, applied to text inspired by Shakespeare. It supports the four fundamental operations:

- ✅ **Insert**
- ❌ **Delete**
- 🔄 **Replace**
- 🔁 **Switch**

The goal is to find the minimum number of edits required to convert one word (or line) into another. This is commonly used in **spell-checking**, **autocorrect**, and **DNA sequence comparison**.

## 📚 Project Overview

- All logic is implemented manually using Python and 2D DP tables
- Designed and tested using real text from **Shakespeare’s works**
- Detailed cost tracking and backtracking to extract the optimal edit sequence
