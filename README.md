Welcome to NLP Fundamentals — a collection of pure Python NLP projects built from scratch, without relying on high-level libraries like spaCy or NLTK. I've developed these projects as part of the Coursera NLP Specialization, carefully walking through each step on my own to deeply understand the algorithms and their foundations.
From implementing a POS tagger using Hidden Markov Models and the Viterbi algorithm, to building an autocorrect model using Minimum Edit Distance and exploring machine translation using Locality Sensitive Hashing, each project is a hands-on journey into the core of natural language processing.

Hope you enjoy it 😀

## 🔄 Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Aliha7ish/NLP-Fundamentals.git
cd NLP-Fundamentals
```
### 📂 Navigate to Any Project
Each project is in its own folder. Use cd to go inside a specific project the notebook is provided in the folder:

#### For the POS Tagger project
```
cd POS Tagging
```

#### For the Autocorrect project
```
cd ./Minimum Edit Distance
```

#### For the Machine Translation project
```
cd ./Machine Translation and LSH
```

### For Naive Bayes Project
```
cd ./Naive Bayes
```

### For Word Vector Project
```
cd ./Word Vector
```

📝 Each folder includes its own README.md with instructions, dataset info, and explanations of the algorithm.
