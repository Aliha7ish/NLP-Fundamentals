Welcome to NLP Fundamentals â€” a collection of pure Python NLP projects built from scratch, without relying on high-level libraries like spaCy or NLTK. I've developed these projects as part of the Coursera NLP Specialization, carefully walking through each step on my own to deeply understand the algorithms and their foundations.
From implementing a POS tagger using Hidden Markov Models and the Viterbi algorithm, to building an autocorrect model using Minimum Edit Distance and exploring machine translation using Locality Sensitive Hashing, each project is a hands-on journey into the core of natural language processing.

Hope you enjoy it ðŸ˜€
