# 🔍 Word Similarity & Visualization with Cosine, Euclidean Distance, and PCA

This project demonstrates how to find **similar words** using **pretrained word vectors** and two distance metrics:

- ✅ **Cosine Distance**
- ✅ **Euclidean Distance**

It also applies **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce high-dimensional vectors to 2D for visualization.

## 📚 Overview

- 🔤 Load pre-trained word embeddings (./word_embeddings_subset.p)
- 🧠 Compute word similarity using:
  - Cosine similarity: measures **angle** between vectors
  - Euclidean distance: measures **straight-line distance**
- 📊 Reduce embeddings to 2D using **PCA**
- 🖼️ Visualize clusters and relationships between words using `matplotlib`
