# 🌍 Machine Translation using KNN & LSH (Approximate Nearest Neighbors)

This project implements a **simple word-level machine translation system** using two approaches:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** with cosine similarity  
2. **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** for fast approximate nearest neighbor search

It demonstrates how to align bilingual word embeddings and perform word-by-word translation from a source language (e.g., English) to a target language (e.g., Spanish or French), entirely from scratch.

## 📚 Overview

- 🔤 Input: Word embeddings for two languages (aligned or with a transformation matrix)
- 🔍 Output: Translations of source language words using KNN or LSH
- 🧠 Goal: Show the tradeoff between accuracy and speed when using approximate nearest neighbors (LSH)
